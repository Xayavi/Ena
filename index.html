    Ena (also spelled as ÆŽNA) is a titular protagonist in the ENA series. This Ena is the protagonist of Season 1 of the series, having a blue and yellow colored body.

    <h2>
    Appearance
    </h2>
    <p>
        Ena is a feminine humanoid character. Up until the end of the episode Temptation Stairway, she possessed a dual-colored body, her right side blue and geometric and her left side yellow and smooth (although, her torso is completely blue and geometric). Her black hair is different lengths on either side, her right side being longer and straight (also showing her blue ear) and her left side resembling a bob cut (also covering her yellow ear) with two triangular ahoges. She also has blunt cut bangs. Her eyes are unique in shape, one being a diamond with a black triangle under it (resembling an eyelash) and the other a half circle. In her form seen at the end of Temptation Stairway, she is fully yellow with both eyes being semicircles, her hair a bob cut on both sides and her two ahoges merged together. Although, the right side of her body is still geometric, however, along with her right ear showing.

        Her outfit consists of a beige collared T-shirt, a black skirt with black overall straps, and a single strap connecting the two going across her chest. She also wears two black socks; one thigh high on her right (which remains in her current form) and one ankle sock on her left. Her clothing, as well as her hair and blue side, have a grain effect over them, causing various scattered pixels to appear over her.

        When happy, Ena's mouth and nose shows on her left side, and they move to the opposite side when she is sad. They are meant to look like the silhouette of a head looking to the side.

    <h2>
        Personality
    </h2>
    <p>
        In Auction Day and Extinction Party, Ena's mood would affect her voice, with her happy/drunk sides sounding masculine and her sad side sounding feminine. However, in Temptation Stairway, her voice and different emotional states do not have strict correlation, with her voice regularly fluctuating between masculine and feminine regardless of how she feels. She is voiced by Gabe Velez, Lizzie Freeman, and Samuel Meza, with the latter voicing her drunk form only.
    </p>
    <p>
        In her happy state, she seems to be very kind, optimistic, and somewhat insightful to others, even if some treat her rudely. For example, she happily greets and talks to Merci upon finding her in the Maze, despite Merci's translated dialogue revealing she acts aggressive in return and warns Ena about the Maze possibly being dangerous, though Ena seems completely unconcerned or unaware of her friend's advice. She also appears to talk "proper" and sophisticated, typically substituting various words for longer or more detailed synonyms.
    </p>
    <p>
        However, mentioning pessimistic things or being in slightly stressful situations, such as large social gatherings, is enough for her to turn into her sad states, where her voice begins to break as if on the verge of tears and she will begin to self-deprecate, usually making disparaging remarks about her intelligence. She will also often beg to be killed while in this form, as shown in her conversations with Keeper and Phindoll, or will depressingly agree with the notion of death when it is presented, such as when she talks to Robert. She also seems to have an easily upset stomach while in this form too, as she is shown vomiting in both Auction Day and Temptation Stairway, the former of which shows her puking out noise. It appears that her happy side takes over as soon as possible whenever she is sad, possibly to keep her from putting herself in serious danger. Whenever this happens, Ena will apologize for her behavior or engage in small talk.
    </p>
    <p>
        The same seemingly goes for her "drunk" side. When she becomes too happy or becomes "euphoric"-like, she will act like she's drunk, laughing at everything and talking in a slower, more slurred manner. Ena doesn't seem to mind her different emotional states and is instead more concerned about the impacts they have on her friends.
    </p>
    <p>
        Ena is also seen to be stubborn in situations that don't involve her own emotions, in which she'll quickly abandon, change or split back and forth from. For example, in the instances she is asked to give blood identification in Extinction Party and Temptation Stairway, she quickly switches to her sad side and appears to brush off the need for such actions by shouting.
